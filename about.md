Hi there, I'm Blat Blatnik - a student of artificial intelligence and a huge programming geek. I decided to create `computerBear` to share some of my coding discoveries and frustrations. 

I'm particularly interested in game development and low-level programming in general, and I'm working on my own game right now.
